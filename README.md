# DHX34 & DDX41 Bioinformatics Project

## Overview
This repository contains a bioinformatics project focused on the study of the DHX34 and DDX41 genes, which are associated with predisposition to hematological neoplasms. The project aims to identify, annotate, and interpret genetic variants in these genes using high-throughput sequencing data.

## Purpose
The main goal is to better understand the genetic landscape and clinical significance of variants in DHX34 and DDX41, both in germline and somatic contexts. This knowledge may contribute to improved diagnosis, risk assessment, and research into the mechanisms underlying blood cancers.

## Context
Variants in DHX34 and DDX41 have been implicated in inherited and acquired forms of myeloid neoplasms. This project integrates data processing pipelines, annotation tools, and visualization scripts to facilitate comprehensive analysis of these genes in large genomic datasets.

## Main Features
- Automated processing and annotation of small and structural variants.
- Integration of clinical and genomic data for interpretation.
- Generation of summary statistics and publication-ready plots.
- Modular and reproducible workflows using Nextflow and R.

## Project Structure
- `main.nf`, `nextflow.config`: Main Nextflow pipeline and configuration.
- `bin/`: R scripts for data cleaning and plotting.
- `data/`: Input data, including raw and processed files.
- `results/`: Output results and plots.
- `modules/`, `subworkflows/`: Modular Nextflow components.
- `docs/`: Documentation and project presentations.
